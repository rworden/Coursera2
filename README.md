=========

"run_analysis.R" is the single script needed to complete the assingment, per the instructions here:
https://class.coursera.org/getdata-005/human_grading/view/courses/972582/assessments/3/submissions

run_analysis.R does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject." 

I also included the raw data in "UCI HAR Dataset" and a codebook that provides basic descriptive information on each variable
